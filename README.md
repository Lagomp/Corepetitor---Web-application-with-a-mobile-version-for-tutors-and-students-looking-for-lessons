# Corepetitor---Web-application-with-a-mobile-version-for-tutors-and-students-looking-for-lessons


The goal will be to design and create a web application, along with a dedicated mobile application, to facilitate contact between tutors who offer their services and students who will be able to contact them and arrange meetings.  

It is to be a dedicated social networking site, containing, in addition to typical elements such as creating and managing an account, functionalities that allow you to associate tutors with students, including using a simple, built-in chat. 
There are three types of accounts (administrator, tutor and student), differing in the available functions. 
Characteristic elements of this website include, for example, specifying the subject and method of tutoring (stationary or remote), creating and viewing offers, a functional filter that facilitates finding an offer based on several criteria, checking the tutor's availability on a selected date.
